# workPlanner.api

## Description
A web app that displays a day planner/calender to allow the user to plan their day hour to hour.  The app runs by using HTML, CSS, and is powered by JQuery and Bootstrap.

### Bug fixes
Currently, the app does save to local storage but unsure how to get the inputs to save on the page even when refreshed.
